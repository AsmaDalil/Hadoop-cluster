# Hadoop-cluster
# In this project you are required to use Amazon EMR services to deploy a Hadoop cluster with 5 nodes. For
this:
1. Get an Account on Amazon EMR. This is a paid service, you should expect to pay around a total of
$0.30 per hour of running the cluster (check the exact billing on Amazon). You will need to
shutdown the cluster and start it every time so as not to be charged.
OR
Deploy the cluster as docker containers on your own laptop
2. Configure the cluster to be able to use HDFS as a distributed storage, run MapReduce jobs (in Java
and Python), Hive, Sqoop, and Hbase. Run tests and collect evidence that the cluster is working
properly.
3. Download and run the classic WordCount Map/Reduce program and collect evidence that it works.
4. Write an run Map/reduce program that Map/reduce program that produces an inverted Index
5. Bonus For AWS EMR users, Use/configure the startcluster (https://github.com/jtriley/StarCluster)
script to fire and shutdown the cluster remotely from your local host. Hint here
